# What you need for your homeserver

Homeserver allows you to do some cool stuffs. You can host media server which serves as your personal Netflix or you can host a file storage server that's kind of like Google drive but only at the cost of your electricity bills and your hardware. Considering those SaaS services can cost you about `$20` to `$40` a month, investing in some decent hardware that costs around `$500` which you own 100% and about `$5` or less monthly electiricity bill seems to be a better solution. But most importantly, I wanted to learn about the server infrastructure. I wanted to know about how my home network works. How I can configure them to tailor my needs. So I begun this project.

I don't know much about the server hardwares or network devices associated with it, although I was in the IT sector for quite some time now. However, most of my daily work is revolved around software application development rangin from web apps, iOS apps, backend RESTful API endpoints and tRPC endpoints and such. So it's pretty safe to assume that I'm very new to this server world.

## Hardwares, lots of hardwares

Getting in to computer hardwares, especially the server hardware, is quite a huge rabbit hole. So many old stuff, new stuff, weried stuff, used stuff and so forth. This literally took me about 2 months to get a slight grasph of the overall picture of this huge ecosystem. Still not too familiar about it but I will dedicate a series about my take on the hardware and which parts I ended up buying to kickstart my noob journey to the server world. For this post, let's just assume that I have some core components like CPU, RAM, Motherboard, Power ready to go.

## It's really all about Networking

OK, So I have this computer ready to be booted up. What now? I have an ethernet cable that's directly hooked into the modem (not router) and a router connected from the modem oozing out wifi signals around my house. There is no additional outward cable connected to the router. How can I get access to the server? Do I connect ethernet cable from my labtop to this new computer directly? (I've seen posts that it's possible) or should I unplug the ethernet cable coming out of the modem and plug it in the router instead? Should I make my own router instead of using this black shitty box provided for free from ISP (Internet Service Provider)?

I can sense that I need a lot to learn regarding networking and this is my attempt to organize my thoughts for the future reference.
