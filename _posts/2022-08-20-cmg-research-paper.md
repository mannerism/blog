## Introduction

- According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the world population aged over 60 years will have doubled in number by 2050, with an estimated total of 2 billion people. `WHO.AgeingandHealth(WHO,2018).`
- Currently it is estimated that 50 million are living with dementia worldwide and nearly 10 million new cases occur every year, representing a serious public health problem. `WorldHealthOrganization.Dementia(WHO,2017).`
- dementia is not considered a normal sequela of aging and prevention should be the key strategy to mitigate the identified risk factors. `Livingston,G.etal.Dementia prevention, intervention andcare: 2020 report of the Lancet Commission. TheLancet 396,413–446(2020).`
- In cognitively healthy people aged 65 or older, there was some evidence from the included studies to suggest that 12 or more weeks of computerized cognitive training may improve cognition. `Gates,N.J.etal.Computerised cognitive training for 12 or more weeks for maintaining cognitive function in cognitivel yhealthy people in late life. Cochrane Database Syst. Rev.`[link](https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD012277.pub3)
- Processing speed training resulted in reduced dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71 (95% CI 0.50–0.99), p = 0.049) compared to control, but memory and reasoning training generated no significant risk reduction (HR 0.79 (0.57–1.11), p = 0.18 and HR 0.79 (0.56–1.10), p = 0.16, respectively). `Edwards,J.D.et al.Speed of processing training results in lower risk of dementia. AlzheimersDement(N.Y.) 3,603–611(2017).`
- The main objective of our study is to add to the current knowledge by evaluating the efficacy of 100 sessions of CMG used in real-life (independently and without specific guidelines on training frequency) in older adults and how the effect may vary as a function of age.

## Results

### CMG Scores

As for the initial scores, we observed an interesting linear trend between age and session, indicating that all participants improved in all CMG but that the progress was slower in older participants.

### Processing speed

For Word Pairs we observed an decrease in the processing speed in all age groups. For `Square Numbers`, `Unique` and `Rush Back` there was a statistically significant increase for all participant age groups, however as for the score, the increase of the processing speed is more marked for younger participants. For `Must Sort`, only participants aged 70 and over presented a decrease in processing speed while the other age groups presented a slight increase, but in both cases the magnitude was relatively small.

## Discussion

- we showed that CMG scores are correlated with the cognitive abilities of older adults with and without cognitive impairments.
- Aging is indeed related to a decrease in cognitive function and an increase in reaction time.
- The literature supports that basic numerial skills are preserved in healthy aging and that deficits may be associated with MCI.

- Though the changes in different cognitive abilities over the lifespan are relatively well-documented, there is less evidence on the plasticity of these different cognitive functions across the lifespan. Furthermore, it has not yet been established whether all cognitive functions can be trained or the extent to which progress can be achieved in healthy subjects of different ages.
- Neuroplasticity is the ability of the brain to modify its structure and function for example under conditions of learning or compensation. We studied a healthy population and therefore the observed improvements are most likely due to training-induced plasticity rather than compensation.
- Previous studies have shown neuroimaging and neurotransmitter changes after cognitive training of working memory in healthy people, that could ultimately lead to an increase of cognitive reserve.

- Cognitive training or sustained engagement in challenging novel tasks like CMGs could enhance the development
  of scaffolding and as a result, confer protection and improvement in cognitive functions.

- Even if the age-related cognitive decline is inevitable, lifelong trajectories of brain and cognitive functions are variable and stay plastic throughout the lifespan.
