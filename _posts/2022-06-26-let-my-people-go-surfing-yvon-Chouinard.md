## Let my people go surfing - Yvon Chouinard

1. Our guiding principle of design stemmed from Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the French aviator:

   - Have you ever thought, not only about the airplane but whatever man builds, that all of man's industrial efforts, all his computations and calculations, all the nights spent working over drafts and blue-prints, invariably culminate in the production of a thing whose sole and guiding principle is the ultimate principle of simplicity?

   - It is as if there were a natural law which ordained that to achieve this end, to refine the curve of a piece of furniture, or a ship's keel, or the fuselage of an airplane, until gradually it partakes of the elementary purity of the curve of the human breast or shoulder, there must be experimentation of several generations of craftsmen. In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness.

1. I've always thought of myself as an 80 percenter. I like to throw myself passionately into a sport or activity until I reach about an 80 percent proficiency level. To go beyond that requires an obession and degree of specialization that doesn't appeal to me. Once I reach that 80 percent level I like to go off and do something totally different; that probably explains the diversity of the Patagonia product line - and why our versatile, multifaceted clothes are the most successful.

1. Someone once said that the poor can't afford to buy cheap goods. You can buy a cheap blender that will burn out the first time you try to grind some ice cubes, or you can wait until you can afford a quality one that will last.

1. The best-performing firms make a narrow range of products very well. The best firms' products also use up to 50 percent fewer parts than thos made by their less successful rivals. Fewer parts means a faster, simpler(and usually cheaper) manuafacturing process. Fewer parts means less to go wrong; quality comes built in.

1. Invention vs Innovation: The big inventions are so rare that even the most brilliant geniuses think up only a few marketable inventions in their lifetimes. It may take thirty years to come up with an invention, but within a few years or months there can be a thousand innovations spawned from that original idea. Innovation can be achieved much more quickly because you already start with an existing product idea or design.

1. When I'm working on a problem. I never think about beauty. I think only how to solve the problem. But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong. - Richard Buckminster Fuller

1. Fashion is happening only now, and art is timeless.
